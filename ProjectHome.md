The aim of this jQuery plugin is to provide a unique way to "panelize" a website.  It brings a new approach to website and web application navigation.

Works as intended in Firefox 3, IE 6,7,8 and Safari 4.

Go to "Downloads" for version 1.1.1 in Zip format or download read-only from source.

**UPDATE 6/27/2010**
I have started development for the next release (2.0) of the plugin that is currently being tested on iPhone and iPad touch devices.  This means having full "swipe-ability".  You can follow progress here: http://standardscompliance.com/development/jquery-panel-magic-v2/ (probably want to view on iPhone or iPad). If you would like to share any preliminary notes/insights, please feel free but DO NOT submit any bug reports as the 2.0 version is still pre-alpha and vastly incomplete.

_Note: The 2.0 version will not be backwards compatible as there are numerous optimizations that are being made within the code that requires some extensive rewrites_
